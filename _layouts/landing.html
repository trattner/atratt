      <p> Dear Future Colleague,</p>

      <p>Seven years ago I entered the working world, stocking inventory and cleaning hermit crab cages at a beach store. My second job was making cheesesteak sandwiches. These experiences reinforced what I learned as a child from building card houses, snow forts, and Hot Wheels rollercoasters &mdash; success comes with hard work.</p>

      <p>Since then, I have controlled research experiments on the International Space Station and founded a nonprofit using technology to support mental health on college campuses across the country. I have designed, built, and tested part or all of a 15lb BattleBot, a $10B space telescope, and a production-ready subroutine speeding fluid dynamics computations threefold for NASA, Xerox, and other companies. I have evaluated startup investments for the people who created TripAdvisor and e-readers, and I was selected by the White House to lead a team of twenty in coordinating and executing a program for the top high school students in the U.S. to meet the First Family. I graduated in June from MIT with a degree in mathematics with computer science, having also studied aerospace engineering, creative writing, and music theory. You can read more about most of these things in my <a href="/img/trattner_res_sd_2018.pdf" target="_blank">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a> or a <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2014/05/portland_teen_andy_trattner_to.html" target="_blank">news article</a> (or <a href=' https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/college-game-plan/mit-students-use-their-smarts-create-texting-hotline-prevents-suicide-n528796' target="_blank">two</a> or <a href="https://blog.ed.gov/2017/07/the-ability-to-inspire/" target="_blank">three</a>).</p>

      <p>What makes me a good employee? While I have avoided specializing in a particular field or role, I have certainly put in my 10,000 hours to become an excellent teammate &mdash; someone whom you will not regret hiring. I am a responsible and organized worker and thinker with the mindset of a certified Engineer. I get things done well yet quickly, and I compulsively target-learn key areas where I or others see deficiency. I am a strong communicator at all organization levels and for nearly any situation (<i>e.g.</i> formal/informal public speaking, technical/non-technical writing, board/C-suite/director/supervisor meetings, legalese, Spanish). I extend the definition of good customer service to include service toward colleagues and the organization as a whole, that we may better accomplish our mission together.</p>

      <p>I am currently looking for a part time job (16-32 hrs per week) in San Diego. The remainder of my working time and energy will be devoted to my long-term passions for teaching and education. I am giving myself two weeks to search, ideally starting work in mid-August. Please feel free at any time to call, text, or email using the contact information provided on my r&eacute;sum&eacute; below. I look forward to interviewing and working with you.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><br><br>Warmly,<br>
      Andy<br>
