        <h2>People Enjoy Working With Me</h2>

        <p>“<i>Andy is, without exaggeration, the most selfless person I have ever met. He takes so much pride in being able to help others, and I am so lucky to have worked with him as a colleague and a friend.</i>” <br><span style="float:right;">&ndash;Alex, Harvard</span></p>

        <p>“<i>Andy taught me how to think like an adult: how to craft effective emails, how to navigate applications, and ultimately how to get into the school of my dreams.</i>” <br><span style="float:right;">&ndash;Wendy, MIT</span></p>

        <p>“<i>I thought working with Andy was like exploring a whole new world. It wasn’t like learning in a classroom&mdash;instead, you get to ask questions freely. You can explore on your own. It was like a rainforest or a safari. When you go on a safari, you can’t say that you want to see the hippos. They will tell you, ‘No, you have to take the lion path first.’ With Andy, you can do that. You can go straight to the hippos.</i>” <br><span style="float:right;">&ndash;Kai, 5th Grader</span></p>

        <p>“<i>Andy really cares about helping people.</i>” <br><span style="float:right;">&ndash;Brad, Princeton</span></p>

        <p>“<i>We weren’t just looking for a tutor who could teach our son 7th grade math, but who could motivate him to learn and give an inspiration for the wider world beyond math. Andy was it.</i>” <br><span style="float:right;">&ndash;Motoko and John, Parents</span></p>

        <p>“<i>Andy is incredibly patient. He has a very unique way of getting to know someone and connecting them with the right resources to reach their goals. I’ve seen it in the Presidential Scholars Program and in other work Andy has done. He’s incredibly supportive and helpful.</i>” <br><span style="float:right;">&ndash;Joyce, Stanford</span></p>
