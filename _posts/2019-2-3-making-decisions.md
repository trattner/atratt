How should we spend our time? What should we be doing? These are vitally important questions, and I've come to appreciate them more and more with age.

There are lots of decision-making frameworks out there, but in my experience, process is secondary to attitude. If we are just going through the motions mechanically, if our heart and soul aren't fully committed to establishing ground truth, then it doesn't really matter which set of questions we choose to ask ourselves. Whatever decision we face, we will simply find a convenient heuristic.

Once we feel deep in our bones that a decision really matters to us, then the process of deciding can be undertaken deliberately. We will recognize that we have something at stake. The question of allocating time becomes one of investing, rather than merely spending.

In order to obtain the best outcome, it's helpful to have a bit of wisdom and experience under our belt. Thankfully, decision-making is a skill, and skills can be nurtured. I've learned the most from others: in-depth conversations with friends where we really try to grasp the basis of each other's thought models, purposeful Q&A with experienced mentors, as well as books, <a href="https://megjay.com/the-defining-decade/" target="_blank">new</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl/dp/080701429X/" target="_blank">old</a> and <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html" target="_blank">older</a>. I've also learned a fair bit from personal reflection. When an interesting thought or idea starts to brew, I give myself permission to take a break, to walk, journal, or simply sit and meditate.

Most decision-making frameworks I've created or encountered reduce to the pro/con schema. People have various adaptations that work for them. For example, I have trouble being objective when it comes to helping others. I'm predisposed to undervalue my personal time and resources relative to the welfare of  others. Being a <a href="http://www.adamgrant.net/give-and-take" target="_blank">giver</a> has been positive for me overall, but I have discovered a need to question this bias when making important decisions.

Maybe we have to decide on a university to attend, or there is a big relationship choice in front of us. Let's consider embarking on a new career or a large project. I would ask myself the following six questions to dive specifically and concretely into the pros and cons.

## 1. How is this directly important, for others or the world at large?

The illuminating <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/" target="_blank">80,000 Hours Podcast</a> asks interviewees why they think their current work is important. This question matters to me because I would prefer for my work to have global upside, and it is motivating to see a direct connection between work and impact. Doing more important work may lead to better opportunities in the future. Folks who can articulate the importance of their work are often better positioned to succeed. Answering this question helps me understand the nature of the commitment in question, and how it relates to my values.

## 2. How does this benefit me today, tomorrow, and 10+ years in the future?

Tangibly beneficial time commitments will anchor me in clear waters, especially if I compulsively embrace serendipity already. Optimism has its place. But the winds of whimsy and the currents of chance can be treacherous. Hope is a dangerous thing. Practical investors prefer returns.

## 3. Why am I uniquely well-suited to do this?

Maybe I have a distinctive combination of skills, or maybe I have a burning passion that will carry me through <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Dip-Little-Book-Teaches-Stick/dp/1591841666/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1509722434&sr=8-1&keywords=the+dip+godin" target="_blank">the dip</a>. A new commitment integrates with existing priorities, needs, availability, and resources. If not, I should rearrange those things to fit the new commitment. As time goes on, harmony binds. Dissonance can lead to dialectics but tends toward dissolution. A project that only says yes to questions one and two is vastly different from one that says yes to question three. It's great to learn from failure, but ultimately, we want to succeed with flying colors. We cannot shine unless we recuse ourselves from mediocrity.

## 4. What will be the realistic total time required?

It's very easy to underestimate project management overhead, the personal time I burn setting up to do the work itself. Is there driving required to get there? Will I ever need to spend an evening doing extra work? To be kind to my future self is to put on my own safety mask first. Unexpected problems arise more frequently than I anticipate, and it can be hard to ask for help. I need to be proactively self-centered. If I'm naturally inclined to push my limits already, then leaving a safety buffer can tip the balance away from burnout when things get busy.

## 5. Do I have other commitments to focus on?

If there are current obligations or goals that I'm failing to meet, an additional commitment might push those other things right off the map. Better to say no, save that passenger for the next trip, and take this chance to right the ship. Or maybe say yes, come on board, but dump the ballast first. Explicating the tradeoffs will expedite and safeguard the voyage.

## 6. Are there personal detriments or liabilities?

Think for a moment about the downsides. In addition to tradeoffs and opportunity costs, there may be speed bumps directly tied to the commitment itself. For example: application fees, wardrobe requirements, unfriendly colleagues, or difficult scheduling. Are you taking out a loan or assuming legal responsibilities? List all these things out. Are they bearable without any of the global or personal upsides that I am imagining in the first couple questions? People forget that their mental models of the future are often constructed upon abstract values. Practical details tend to dominate the present. It can be easy to wish away debt with hope, until it's time to sell the restaurant or go back to school for a different degree.
