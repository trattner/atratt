Dear Future Colleague,

Seven years ago, I entered the working world. My first job was stocking inventory and cleaning hermit crab cages at a beach store. My second was cooking and prep at a cheesesteak sandwich shop. These experiences reinforced what I learned as a child from building card houses, snow forts, and Hot Wheels rollercoasters --- success comes with hard work.

Since then, I have controlled research experiments on the International Space Station and founded a nonprofit using technology to support mental health on college campuses across the country. I have designed, built, and tested part or all of a 15lb BattleBot, a $10B space telescope, and a production-ready subroutine speeding fluid dynamics computations threefold for NASA, Xerox, and other companies. I have evaluated startup investments for the people who created TripAdvisor and Ereaders, and I was selected by the White House to lead a team of twenty in coordinating and executing a program for the top high school students in the U.S. to meet the First Family. You can read more about most of these things in my resume or a news article https://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2014/05/portland_teen_andy_trattner_to.html (or two https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/college-game-plan/mit-students-use-their-smarts-create-texting-hotline-prevents-suicide-n528796 or three https://blog.ed.gov/2017/07/the-ability-to-inspire/).

What makes me a good hire? While I have avoided specializing in a particular field or role, I have certainly put in my 10,000 hours to become an expert at teamwork --- someone whom you will not regret hiring. I am a responsible and organized worker and thinker: I get things done quickly and I compulsively target learn key areas where I am lacking. I am a strong communicator at all organization levels and for nearly any situation (formal / informal public speaking, technical / non-technical writing, board / C-suite / director / supervisor meetings, legalese, Spanish). I extend the definition of good customer service to include service towards collegues and the organization as a whole, that we may better accomplish our mission together.

I am currently looking for a part time job (16-32 hrs per week) in San Diego, so that I may have ample free time to devote to my long-term passions for teaching and education. I am giving myself two weeks to search, ideally starting work in mid-August. Please feel free at any time to call, text, or email using the contact information provided on my resume. I look forward to interviewing and working with you.

Warmly,
Andy
