<a href="https://lean0n.me" target="_blank">Lean On Me</a> is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that uses technology to facilitate challenging conversations and improve student mental health on college campuses. The organization makes it quick and easy to receive quality support from an anonymous peer via text message.

I created Lean On Me in the fall of 2015 with the help of many others. We all felt an effective peer-based alternative to existing mental health resources would meet a lot of needs. The concept grew surprisingly quickly from a vague idea into a prize-winning hackathon project and well-known student group. We started getting press coverage, from niche blogs and magazines to an Associated Press story that made its way to major news outlets.

Our little project ended up going through a startup accelerator to become a national entity, less than a year after inception. It has been incredible to see inbound interest from student leaders around the globe. One pillar of the Lean On Me philosophy that has driven much of our approach is articulated by Libby Mahaffy in our "Hurricane" training video.

My biggest contributions all occurred between September 2015 and June 2016, when I led the team (rather frantically while taking 5 classes) in breaking lots of new ground and growing the organization towards sustainability. For example: drawing the original logo and creating the Lean On Me brand, recruiting team members and advisors, designing training programs and marketing campaigns, writing legal policies, fundraising, coding a rudimentary admin interface, etc. I couldn't have done any of it without our amazing team, some of whom are pictured below.

In early July 2016, I transitioned to an advisor role. Upon incorporation, I joined the board of directors. Like all great opportunities, Lean On Me has altered the course of my life and shaped me in many ways. It's been tremendously heartwarming to see the impact and momentum continue.
