I have made plenty of amusing mistakes during technical interviews. For example, a quantitative trader asked how many handshakes occur among a dozen people who all shake each other's hand exactly once. I quickly responded, "twelve factorial," which was met by a friendly pause, "how long do you estimate that would take?"

The most cringeworthy interview I've had consisted of a single task: to recreate this <a href="https://www.google.com/logos/2011/worldsfair.html" target="_blank">Google Doodle effect</a>. I wasn't prepared at all, and I floundered around with a couple img tags for a full 60 minutes, utterly failing to make any sort of progress.

I promptly went to an empty classroom and set aside my homework, spending the next three hours learning a bit of Javascript to produce the desired <a href="https://github.com/trattner/scale" target="_blank">code</a>. It's proudly on display <a href="https://trattner.github.io/scale" target="_blank">here</a>.
